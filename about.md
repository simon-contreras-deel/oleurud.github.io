Hi, I’m Simon Martin, a software developer based in Santander, Spain.

I have played many roles in my career, mainly as a backend engineer, but also as a full stack developer, tech lead and engineering manager. My tech journey has been diverse, spanning sectors like travel, advertising, GIS, telecom, car insurance, product testing or customer feedback.

My main skills:

•	Product-oriented: I don’t understand technology any other way.
•	Business-oriented: I’ve started a company twice and worked in several startups, helping them (sometimes 🙂) move from 0 to 1. Product-led, SaaS, B2B, B2C.
•	Versatile developer: I can create products from scratch or work with large legacy codebases. I can design simple APIs or work with complex architectures.
•	Versatile tech stack: I’m skilled in Node.js and Vue.js, but I quickly pick up new technologies. I have worked with Python, Java, PHP, C, and others. My database experience includes PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB. I’ve used AWS and Google Cloud.
•	Team player and leader: Whether as an individual contributor or leading a team, I enjoy mentoring junior developers, improving processes, and helping teams reach their full potential to deliver the best product possible.

I’m a father of two amazing kids, a car enthusiast, and I love craft beer, music, and tech. I believe in being straightforward and honest, and I’m always up for a good conversation over a great beer.
